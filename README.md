# Hello-world
I'm new to programming and I cannot wait to learn something new. I spend my free time hanging out with friends, obsessing over music, being a coffee snob, seaking outdoor adventure, and gaming occasionally. I started streaming on TWITCH during quarantine :)! I love to write in my journal and learn new languages. I would love to write a book one day. It's no surprise that talking is one of my favorite activities.
I'm not sure if I am doing this right, but here goes nothing.
